<p>Hong Kong became a colony of the British Empire after
Qing China ceded Hong Kong Island at the end of the First
Opium War in 1842.[16] The colony expanded to the Kowloon
Peninsula in 1860 after the Second Opium War, and was
further extended when Britain obtained a 99-year lease of
the New Territories in 1898.[17][18] The territory was
returned to China when the lease expired in 1997.[19]
As a special administrative region, Hong Kong's system of
government is separate from that of mainland China[20]
and its people overwhelmingly identify as Hongkongers
rather than Chinese</p>
